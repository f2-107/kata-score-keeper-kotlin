# KataScoreKeeper-Kotlin
Starter sources for code kata for train ensemble programming (mob programming) or pair programming.

## The task
We need a software to deliver the proper data to the scoreboard for a basketball match. The teams in the match can score 1, 2, or 3 points.

So, write a console application to add a score to the match result.

Use the function `score(team, score)` to solve this.

After every score you should display the score board with the `showScoreBoard(teamA, teamB)` function.
It should look like this:
```text
*************************
* Team A | 2:3 | Team B *
*************************
```
Hint: Use `*` for the border, whitespaces before and after the team names and the score (including the delimiter).
